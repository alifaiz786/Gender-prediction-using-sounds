# Gender-prediction-using-sounds
In this project, I utilized the Python module Fuzzy to determine the genders of authors who have been on the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture Books in this assignment. 

First, I used fuzzy (sound) name matching to look for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration, which includes the names and genders of everyone who has applied for a Social Security Card. The author dataset will then be aggregated by gender. Finally, I visualized the gender distribution of children's picture book authors across time using the new dataset.
